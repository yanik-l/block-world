The goal of this assignment was to create a GUI which utlises classes and files themed around a blockworld. The GUI displays the game world and has options for users to interact with the
world. The block world in this assignment includes: 
  • a set of tiles containing blocks,
  • a variety of different block types, and
  • a character (a builder) who can manipulate the blocks.

The user is able to:
  • launch a game window,
  • load world maps from the game window,
  • display the loaded map,
  • perform actions on the world by using control elements in the game window,
  • provide helpful messages to users on any failures,
  • display the updated world map once an action is performed, and
  • save the updated world map.
